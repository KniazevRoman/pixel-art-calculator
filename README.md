# Pixel-art-calculator project

This repository is the last project of the Foundations path of the Odin Project self-taught project (https://www.theodinproject.com/). The Odin Project is focused on building knowledge by doing.

The main goal of the "Calculator" project (https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/calculator) is to combine everything a student have learned so far.

I have made the design of the calculator myself. It is inspired by old pixel 8-bit games of the 90s. 

The calculator works exactly like the real one. To start working you need to activate it by pressing the Power button. It supports multiple pressses on operand buttons, dividing by zero, displaying large numbers (the screen is not overfilled).

The layout is responsive and optimized for mobile devices.
